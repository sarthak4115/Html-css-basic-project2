# Project 2 - Image Stack with Hover Effect (HTML & CSS)

This is a basic **HTML and CSS** project demonstrating an overlapping stack of images with a card-style layout. When hovered, the images shift forward using `z-index`, creating a visual layering effect.

## ✨ Project Features

- Overlapping image cards using absolute positioning
- `rotate` effect to slightly tilt each image for a stylish layout
- `z-index` manipulation on hover to bring images to the front
- Fully responsive layout using Flexbox for central alignment
- Clean and minimal styling using only HTML & CSS

## 📂 File Structure


## 📸 What It Does

- Displays four image cards stacked on top of each other
- Each card is rotated slightly to create a layered, fanned-out appearance
- Hovering on any card increases its `z-index`, making it appear on top of others
- Great for image preview showcases, gallery UI mockups, or learning visual layering

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Positioning, Transform, Z-index)

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By working on this project, you can learn:

- How to use `position: absolute` for overlapping layouts
- How to manipulate `z-index` and `transform: rotate()`
- How to build image galleries or card layouts
- Basics of hover effects without JavaScript
